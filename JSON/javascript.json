		"Question": "Why it is not preferable to always use global variables in JavaScript?",
		"Answer": "Global Variables are not always preferable because the same name can't be used for functions and variables since it will overwrite the type and 
		it will also affect the performance since global variables will be added as a property to the window object. The reuse of global variables may overwrite the 
		previous value and type of it during asynchronous code executions.",
